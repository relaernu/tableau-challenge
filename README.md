With the tableau visualization, I have found some interesting and unexpected phenomena:

1. The total number for different points are in greatly difference, especially or the hottest point. Comparing the hottest point to the points near it, the total number may have more than 50% diffrence.

2. The total number of riders continuously drop during the first 5 months of the recording period and suddenly had a great increase in Mar 2021. I think that's because from Oct to Feb the weather was getting cold so fewer people chose to ride a bike.

3. The subscribers had greatly drop and non-subscribers had greatly increase. Which may be the cause of the "Unknown" gender increased.

4. The age group of 46-55 riders had been sigificant increased in Mar, it has reach about 90% of the total number of riders in this Month. May have to do some more analysis to find out if this is the true data.
